AI-Powered Applicant Tracking System (ATS) ü§ñ

This project is an advanced Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to automate and enhance the candidate screening process. 
By integrating a powerful Large Language Model (LLM), it intelligently parses and ranks resumes against job descriptions, significantly improving recruitment efficiency and accuracy.

‚ú® Key Features

Automated Candidate Screening: Eliminates the need for manual review by automatically analyzing resumes and identifying the most qualified candidates.
Intelligent Job Matching: Uses semantic understanding to match candidate skills and experience with job requirements, going beyond simple keyword matching.
RAG-Powered Analysis: Employs a sophisticated RAG pipeline to provide context-aware and accurate evaluations of each candidate's suitability.
Customizable Prompts: Allows for fine-tuning the screening criteria through custom prompt engineering to align with specific roles and company needs.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

The system is built on a modern stack designed for high-performance AI applications:
Orchestration Framework    : LangChain is used to structure the RAG pipeline, connecting the different components seamlessly.
Large Language Model (LLM) : LLaMA 3.0 (accessed via the Groq API) serves as the core reasoning engine for evaluating candidates.
Text Splitting             : The RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from LangChain is used to break down long resumes into semantically meaningful chunks for effective processing.
Embeddings Model           : OllamaEmbeddings are utilized to convert the text chunks from resumes into vector representations.
Vector Database            : Chroma DB is used for efficient storage and retrieval of the resume embeddings, enabling rapid similarity searches.

The core of the system is its RAG architecture. The model's final evaluation E is generated by providing the LLM with the job description J and the retrieved, relevant resume context C:

E=LLaMA3(J,C)
